`useFormatNumber` provides a number with commas and handles a range of numbers.

This function formats a number with commas and handles a range of numbers.

1. If one number is passed, it formats that number with commas.
2. If two numbers are passed, it creates a range:
   - Numbers are formatted with commas.
   - En dash (`–`) is used for the range.
3. Allows numbers passed as strings (e.g., "123456").

Examples:

- (4382) -> "4,382"
- (4276835) -> "4,276,835"
- (1, 99) -> "1–99"
- (141, 58) -> "58–141"
- (100, 102) -> "100–102"
- (10, 100) -> "10–100"
- ("200", "100") -> "100–200"
- ("200XX", "100") -> null
- ("200XX", "100XX") -> null
