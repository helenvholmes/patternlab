 The `useScrollFadeStyles` hook manages the visibility of a right-side fade effect
 based on horizontal scrolling. It tracks scroll events and shows the fade effect 
 when scrolling to the left and more content is available to the right, hiding it 
 when scrolling right or when at the right edge of the scrollable container.
