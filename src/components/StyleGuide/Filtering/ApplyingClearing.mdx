## Methods

Filters should be applied and cleared using one of two methods: live filtering or batch filtering.

### Live filtering

- Data is updated in real-time as the user selects filtering options.
- This is the recommended method for applying filters because:
  - Users tend to expect and are familiar with real-time filtering due to its
    prevalence in e-commerce and elsewhere.
  - We have observed in previous research that users tend to miss `Apply`
    buttons, particularly when they sit out of sight on the page.
  - Batch filtering comes at the risk of returning zero results after which
    users have to engage in a trial-and-error process to get useful results.

### Batch filtering

- The user selects multiple filtering options and the data is updated after the
  user takes the additional action of clicking the "Apply filters" button
  included in the `filter bar`.
- This method is recommended for:
  - very heavy data sets
  - low performing apps

## Applying filters

When filters are applied, the following should be addressed:

- update the `active filters` list based on the filter options that have been
  selected
- update the `results` list based on the filter options that have been selected
- update the `total results` heading to reflect the number of items in the
  updated `results` list

## Clearing filters

Filters can be cleared using various methods within the page structure,
including global methods as well as methods for clearing individual filters.

When filters are cleared, the following should be addressed:

- if a global "clear filters" button is clicked, reset all the form input
  elements within the `filter bar`
- update the `active filters` list to remove all filter options
- update the `results` list to an unfiltered state
- update the `total results` heading to reflect the number of items in the
  updated `results` list

### Keyword search

- All filters that have been applied should be removed any time a keyword search
  is executed (i.e. a new keyword search always produces a new unfiltered
  results list)

### Filter bar

- Click the "Clear all filters" button in the `filter bar` (if available) to
  remove all filters that have been applied

### Active filters list

- Click an "active filter" tag rendered in the `active filters` list to remove a
  specific filter that has been applied
- Click the "Clear filters" button in the `active filters` list to remove all
  filters that have been applied

### Form input components

Many form input components can be reset manually. Examples include, but may not
be limited to, the following methods:

- **DatePicker component**
  - Deleting a date that has been entered into the input field
  - Clicking the clear X
- **MultiSelect component**
  - Unchecking a checkbox to remove that single selected option (or set of
    options in case of nested filters)
  - Clicking the "total options selected" pill button next to the heading to
    remove all selected options
- **TextInput component**
  - Deleting text that has been entered into the input field
  - Clicking the clear X
- **Toggle component**
  - Clicking the component to return the toggle to its initial state

## Populating results

`OR` logic should be used within a filtering facet.

- Ex: selecting `English (5)` and `Spanish (2)` from a `Languages` filter should
  yield 7 results in total

`AND` logic should be used between categories.

- Ex: selecting `Spanish (2)` from a `Languages` filter should cause other
  filters to update their options, adjusting the number of associated items for
  each option and disabling options with 0 associated items
