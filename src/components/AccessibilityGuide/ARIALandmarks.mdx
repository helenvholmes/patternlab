# ARIA Landmarks

## Overview

ARIA landmarks denote important sections of a page that a user might want to navigate to directly. Adding landmark roles essentially creates "skip links"
for assistive technologies to find content quickly.

Each landmark role has a corresponding semantic element:

| Landmark role | HTML element        |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| banner        | document `<header>` |
| complementary | `<aside>`           |
| contentinfo   | document `<footer>` |
| form          | `<form>`            |
| main          | `<main>`            |
| navigation    | `<nav>`             |
| region        | `<section>`         |
| search        | `<search>`          |

### `<search>`

The `<search>` HTML element is a container for the search/filter functionality, and defines a search landmark.

Inspect the below Story to see `<search>` in the DOMâ€“ notice that it wraps the `Heading`, the `Searchbar`, and the `Checkbox`:

<Canvas of={SearchBarStories.WithSearchElement} />
